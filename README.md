## Models Implemented
- VGG16 (Main implementation)
- ResNet50
- ResNet101
- EfficientNetB0

## Dataset
The dataset consists of scene images divided into six categories:
- Buildings
- Forest
- Glacier
- Mountain
- Sea
- Street

## Implementation Details

### Model Training
1. Data preprocessing and augmentation
2. Transfer learning with VGG16 base
3. Custom layers added for classification
4. Training with early stopping
5. Model weights saving for deployment

### Streamlit Application
The web application allows users to:
- Upload images for classification
- View prediction results
- See confidence scores for each class
- Visualize probability distribution

## Setup and Installation

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run notebooks/app.py
```

### Model Training
1. Extract data:
```python
# Extract training and test data
extract_zip('seg_train.zip', extract_path)
extract_zip('seg_test.zip', extract_path)
```

2. Train model:
```python
# Run the training notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/scene_classification.ipynb
```

3. Save weights:
```python
# Save model weights
model.save_weights('scene_classifier_full.weights.h5')
```

## Usage

### Web Application
1. Visit the [Scene Classification App](your_streamlit_app_link_here)
2. Upload an image using the file uploader
3. View the classification results and confidence scores

### Local Testing
1. Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run notebooks/app.py
```
2. Open browser at `http://localhost:8501`
3. Upload images for classification

## Model Performance

## Implementation Notes
- Using on-the-fly data augmentation during training
- Transfer learning with frozen VGG16 base layers
- Custom top layers for classification
- Early stopping for optimal model selection
- Memory-efficient data handling

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud:
1. Model weights are saved as 'scene_classifier_full.weights.h5'
2. Streamlit app loads weights dynamically
3. Real-time image processing and prediction
